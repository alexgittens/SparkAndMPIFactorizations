\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Matrix factorizations are an important class of linear algebra computations
with broad applications in Big Data analytics. In this work, we have
successfully developed highly optimized distributed multi-node
versions of the CX algorithm.
%%, both on a single node, as well as distributed multi-node implementations. 
We utilize
Spark as a contemporary productive data analytics framework for developing and deploying
the CX algorithm, and successfully demonstrate the implementation scaling up to
960 cores. 
We also implemented a close-to-metal parallelized C version, which runs 21X
faster than the Spark version (on Amazon EC2 system). Further examination of this performance gap; and it's attribution to various components of the Spark stack will be conducted in the near future. 

Using the Spark version, we evaluate our parallel implementation on HPC and EC2 class
hardware; we find that faster interconnects enable the numerically intensive
computations to run more efficiently on HPC systems. Finally, this scalable
implementation was used to analyze a large TB-sized mass-spec imaging
dataset; the resulting ion and spatial patterns obtained from the analysis are
providing biologists with novel insights on complex molecular mechanisms in
cells.
